          <p>The front end is the part of the website users can see and interact with such as the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line including the design, navigating menus, texts, images, videos, etc. The backend, on the contrary, is part of the website users cannot see and interact with.
            The visual aspects of the website that can be seen and experienced by users are frontend. On the other hand, everything that happens in the background can be attributed to the backend.
            Languages used for the front end are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while those used for the back end include Java, Ruby, Python, and .Net.
            </p>
          <p>Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you canâ€™t see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.</p>
